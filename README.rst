Introduction
------------

``hubugs`` is a very simple client for working with `GitHub's issue tracker`_.

.. important::

   This package is in a *rapid* state of flux right now, as support for version
   3 of the `GitHub API`_ is added.  Be aware there may be some significant
   changes to the user interface coming soon!

Requirements
------------

``hubugs`` requires Python_ v2.6 or above.  ``hubugs``'s mandatory
dependencies outside of the standard library are argh_, blessings_, html2text_,
httplib2_, Jinja_, kitchen_, Pygments_ and schematics_.

Configuration
-------------

Before ``hubugs`` can operate on issues you must generate an OAuth_ token.
``hubugs`` provides functionality to do this::

    $ hubugs setup
    GitHub user? [JNRowe]
    GitHub password? <password>
    Support private repositories? (Y/n) y
    Configuration complete!

.. note::

   You can revoke the generated token at any time from the `GitHub settings`_
   page.

If you wish to set the authorisation token from the command line you can use the
``HUBUGS_TOKEN`` environment variable.  For example::

    $ HUBUGS_TOKEN=xxx hubugs open

Hacking
-------

Patches and `pull requests`_ are most welcome, but I'd appreciate it if you
could follow the guidelines below to make it easier to integrate your changes.
These are only guidelines however, and as such can be broken if the need arises
or you just want to convince me that your style is better.

* `PEP 8`_, the style guide, should be followed where possible.
* While support for Python versions prior to v2.6 if such a need were to arise,
  you are encouraged to use v2.6 features now
* All new classes, methods and functions should be accompanied by new
  reStructuredText_ formatted descriptions
* You should add tests for new functionality, and berate me for not writing
  enough tests at the outset
* Tests *must not* span network boundaries, use of a common mocking framework is
  encouraged

Bugs
----

If you find any problems, bugs or just have a question about this package
either file an issue_ or drop me a mail_.

If you've found a problem please attempt to include a minimal testcase so
I can reproduce the problem, or even better a patch!
