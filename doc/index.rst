:mod:`hubugs`
=============

.. warning::

   I don't really use GitHub anymore, so this package is somewhat orphaned.  It
   should still work *and* I will fix bugs when they're pointed out, but
   ``hubugs`` is frankly quite a low priority for me.


:mod:`hubugs` is a very simple client for working with `GitHub's issue
tracker`_ from the command line.

It is written in Python_, and works with Python 2.6 and newer(including Python
3).  :mod:`hubugs` is released under the `GPL v3`_
