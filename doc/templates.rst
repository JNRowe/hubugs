Templates
=========

Output is produced from templates using Jinja_.  Before writing your own
templates you should read the awesome `Jinja template designer`_ documentation.

Template locations
------------------

Templates are loaded from directories in the following order:

* If it exists, ``${XDG_DATA_HOME:~/.local}/hubugs/templates``
* Any :file:`hubugs/templates` directory in the directories specified by
  :envvar:`XDG_DATA_DIRS`
* The package's ``templates`` directory

For information on the usage of :envvar:`XDG_DATA_HOME` and
:envvar:`XDG_DATA_DIRS` read `XDG Base Directory Specification`_

.. note::
   If you create some cool templates of your own please consider posting them in
   an issue_ or pushing them to a fork on GitHub_, so that others can benefit.

Precedence
----------

The first name match in the order specified above selects the template, so a
:file:`view/list.txt` in :file:`${XDG_DATA_HOME}/hubugs/templates` overrides
the :file:`view/list.txt` provided in the :mod:`hubugs` package.

Template sets
-------------

You can specify the template set to use by defining a `hubugs.templates`
setting in your git configuration files.  For example::

    â–¶ git config --global hubugs.templates my_templates

You can also set project specific template sets by editing a repository's
config.  See :manpage:`git-config(1)`.

Naming
------

Templates are separated in to two groups.  The first group, ``view``, is for
templates used in directly producing consumable output(such as from the ``list``
subcommand).  The second group, ``edit``, is for templates used to generate
input files for editing text(such as in the ``open`` subcommand).

``view`` group templates currently include:

* :file:`issue.txt` for formatting a single bug
* :file:`list.txt` for formatting list output

``edit`` group templates currently include:

* :file:`default.mkd` for general use, such as in commenting on a bug
* :file:`open.mkd` for opening(or editing) bugs

Data
----

The following variables are available for use in templates

View group
''''''''''

.. data:: columns(int)

   The width of the current terminal window

``list.txt`` data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. data:: bugs(list)

   Contains the sorted list of bugs to display, if any.  See
   :ref:`bug_objects-label`.

.. data:: id_len(int)

   Set to the maximum length of the bug IDs to display

.. data:: state(str)

   The bug states being searched/listed

.. data:: order(str)

   The display order

.. data:: term(str)

   The search term being listed, if any

``issue.txt`` data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. data:: bug(list)

   Contains the sorted list of bugs to display, if any.  See
   :ref:`bug_objects-label`

.. data:: comments(list)

   When displaying a single bug this contains the list of comments associated
   with a bug, if any.  See :ref:`comment_objects-label`

.. data:: full(bool)

   True, if the user provided the :option:`hubugs show -f` option

.. data:: patch(str)

   The content found at the location in :attr:`Bug.patch_url`, if the user
   provided the :option:`hubugs show -p` option

Edit group
''''''''''

.. data:: title(str)

   The current bug title in ``edit`` subcommand sessions.  See
   :attr:`Bug.title`

.. data:: body(str)

   The current bug body in ``edit`` subcommand sessions, if any.  See
   :attr:`Bug.body`

All groups
''''''''''

Jinja templates support object attribute and method access, so an individual
``bug`` object's :data:`~Bug.created_at` attribute can be called with a
:meth:`~datetime.datetime.strftime` method for custom date output.  For example,
``{{ bug.created_at.strftime("%a, %e %b %Y %H:%M:%S %z") }}`` can be used to
output an :rfc:`2822`-style date stamp.

If you're authoring your own templates and you find you need extra data for
their generation open an issue_.

Filters
-------

:mod:`hubugs` defines the following filters beyond the huge range of excellent
`built-in filters`_ in Jinja_:

.. note::

   If you write extra filters that you believe could be of use to other
   :mod:`hubugs` users please consider posting them in an issue_ or pushing
   them to a fork on GitHub_, so that others can benefit from your work.

``colourise``
'''''''''''''

This filter applies a colour to text, if possible.  This functionality requires
:pypi:`termcolor`, if the module is unavailable the filter is simply a no-op.

When directing output to a pipe or using a terminal that is incapable of
displaying colours the text is passed through unchanged.

For example, to show a bug's ``title`` attribute in red::

    {{ bug.title | colourise('red') }}

.. note::
   This filter is also available under the synonym ``colorize``.

``highlight``
'''''''''''''

This filter highlights text using Pygments_.  You can specify the lexer to
be used, and also the formatter.

For example, to highlight a chunk of text as Python::

    {{ text | highlight('python') }}

To do the same using the 256-colour mode of Pygments_::

    {{ text | highlight('python', 'terminal256') }}

See the output of :program:`pygmentize -L` for the list of available lexers and
formatters.

``html2text``
'''''''''''''

This filter converts HTML to a plain text representation using html2text_.

.. _markdown-label:

``markdown``
''''''''''''

The purpose of this filter is to convert the Markdown_ formatted text from
a GitHub issue to html.  The excellent markdown2_ package is used to provide the
conversion.

In the default templates it is used to render bug bodies::

    {{ comment.body | markdown | html2text }}

.. note::
   We ping-pong the conversion from Markdown to HTML as it produces a prettier
   text representation of the comment.  We benefit from uniform newline usage
   and clean word wrapping of the output.

``relative_time``
'''''''''''''''''

This filter is used to generate a human-readable relative timestamp from a
:class:`~python:datetime.datetime` object.

For example, to display a bug's ``created_at`` attribute as a relative time::

    {{ bug.created_at | relative_time }}

which could produce output such as::

    about two months ago

``term_markdown``
'''''''''''''''''

This filter is a very simple way pretty print Markdown_ formatted text. It only
handles headings, horizontal rules and emphasis currently.

It is not recommended that you use this filter, but it is available as fallback
for people who do not wish to use the full :ref:`markdown-label` filter.

An example of its usage could be::

    {{ comment.body | wordwrap(break_long_words=False) | term_markdown }}

Note that we pass the text through Jinja's built-in :func:`jinja:wordwrap`
filter prior to formatting with ``term_markdown`` so that the terminal escape
sequences aren't included in the line width calculations for wrapping.
